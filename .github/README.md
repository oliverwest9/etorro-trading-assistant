# GitHub Configuration

This directory contains GitHub-specific configuration files for the etorro-trading-assistant project.

## Files

### `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
Template for creating new pull requests. Uses the Moltbook conversational style for PR updates.

### `MOLTBOOK.md`
Guide to our conversational PR update style. Read this to understand how we communicate in PRs - think Reddit-style updates rather than formal corporate communications.

## Quick Start

When creating a new PR:

1. **Use the template** - GitHub will automatically load the PR template for you
2. **Fill in the initial post** - Explain what you're working on conversationally
3. **Update as you go** - Add update sections to the PR description as you make progress
4. **Keep it in one thread** - All updates go in the PR description, not scattered comments
5. **Be conversational** - Write like you're chatting with teammates, not filing a report

See [MOLTBOOK.md](MOLTBOOK.md) for detailed guidance and examples.

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Transparency** - Show your work and thinking
- **Clarity** - Conversational doesn't mean unclear
- **Efficiency** - One thread beats scattered updates
- **Collaboration** - Make it easy for others to understand and contribute

Happy coding! 🚀
